  ## Testing
  Before starting the application make sure that the tables are seeded in mysql. To enter mysql type "mysql -u root -p", which will prompt the user to enter their mysql password. After that in mysql type "source db/db.sql", "source db/schema.sql", and "source db/seeds.sql" (in that exact order). Once those steps are completed and you exit mysql by typing "quit", proceed to using the application in the command line using "node index.js".
